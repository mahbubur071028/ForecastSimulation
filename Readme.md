Bank System
Customers arrive  Sign-in  Get Help
Three types of customers
Basic need customers: 
They are directed to either an ATM (most likely) or a Teller by the SignIn employee
Moderate need customers: 
They can be directed to an ATM or a Teller (most likely) or a Manager
Advanced need customers: 
They can be directed to a Teller or a Manager (most likely)

SignIn is where one bank employee helps a customer how to navigate in the bank
After SignIn, a customer is told to go to either ATM line, Teller Line, or Manager Line
SignIn time depends on the customer type


Bank System
Three types of service providers
ATM area: 
A single queue feeds to ATM service area
An ATM execution time is independent of the customer type
Currently there are 3 ATMs in the ATM service area
Tellers: 
A single queue feeds to the Tellers
A Teller execution time is independent of the customer type
Currently there are 4 tellers
Managers: 
A single queue feeds to the Managers
A Manager execution time is independent of the customer type
Currently there are 2 managers

All queue disciplines are first-come-first-served


The bank is planning to hire two additional employees and want to use simulation to decide for which positions these two additional employees should be hired?
There are the following 4 hiring scenarios
Scenario A : 2 sign-in employees, 0 teller, 0 manager
Scenario B : 0 sign-in employee, 2 tellers, 0 manager
Scenario C : 0 sign-in employee, 0 teller, 2 managers
Scenario D : 1 sign-in employee, 1 teller, 0 manager
Scenario E : 1 sign-in employee, 0 teller, 1 manager
Scenario F : 0 sign-in employee, 1 teller, 1 manager
Comparison is based on the following:
How much time a customer spends in the bank (from entrance until leaving) on average?
How many customers are present inside the bank on average?
How much time customers directed to each service option (ATM, Teller, Manager) spend in the corresponding queue on average?
